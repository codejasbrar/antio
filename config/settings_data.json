Enough said&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Antioxidant Rich<\/strong>: &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Moringa is <strong>Antioxidant Rich<\/strong> and contains two strong Antioxidants called Quercetin, a powerful antioxidant which can assist in <strong>lowering blood pressure<\/strong>, &amp; Chlorogenic acid which assists in moderating <strong>blood sugar levels<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anti &ndash; Inflammatory<\/strong><strong>:&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Studies such as the Carrageenan-induced paw edema test have shown, that Moringa leaves possess <strong>anti-inflammatory properties<\/strong>, assisting in reducing inflammation in the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Natural Antibiotic<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> Studies using the agar dilution method demonstrates that Moringa possesses natural <strong>antibiotic and antibacterial properties<\/strong>, which assists in inhibiting the growth of various pathogens. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Complete Amino Acid<\/strong>: &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The problem? The human body cannot synthesize 9 of the 20 amino acids from other compounds in the body, therefore the body must look externally to obtain the 9 essential amino acids. Furthermore most plant foods are deficient in one or more essential amino acids, making this a difficult task (especially if you&rsquo;re vegan).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re Answer, Moringa! Being a <strong>complete plant protein<\/strong> means it contains all <strong>9 essential<\/strong> amino acids. For other great protein sources see Chlorella as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rich in Nutrients: <\/strong>Jam packed <strong>with 27 vitamins<\/strong> and <strong>numerous minerals<\/strong>, gram for gram Moringa leaves contain: Twice the protein of yoghurt; four times the vitamin A of carrots; three times the potassium of bananas; four times the calcium of milk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Quite the Flex&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fights tiredness and Fatigue: <\/strong>An extension to the above Moringa is Rich in Iron and Vitamin A.

Vitamin A supports the <strong>metabolism<\/strong> of iron ensuring a greater uptake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Digestive Aid<\/strong>: Moringa contains substantial amounts of Fibre, which can help support a healthy digestive system and bowel regularity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion the diet of people in developing nations often lacks vitamins, minerals and protein. In these countries, Moringa can be an important source of many essential nutrients.&nbsp;<\/p>","ingredients_text":"<p>100% pure Moringa Leaf&nbsp;<\/p>","directions_text":"<p><strong>Smoothie<\/strong>: Add 1 tsp (5 grams) Moringa&nbsp;Powder to your Smoothie and\/or Smoothie Bowl&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Face Mask<\/strong>: Mix 1 tsp (5 grams) Moringa&nbsp;Powder, 2 tsp Water, 1 tsp baking powder [optional 1 tsp honey] and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;<\/p>","faqs_text":"<p><strong>What is <\/strong><strong>Moringa<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Moringa Tree or Moringa Oleifera to use its scientific name, is a medium-sized tree that is native to Africa and Asia. Every part of the Moringa tree has value: its seeds can be used to purify water; its bark, roots and flowers all have incredible medicinal properties and its leaves are one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Chirp Nation Moringa is made from the finest quality young Moringa leaves which are harvested, naturally dried and ground into a powder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is <\/strong><strong>Chirp Nation&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Moringa Powder made?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our&nbsp;Moringa is a natural powder made from dried Moringa leaves. Although the processing of Moringa leaves is simple, the quality is dependent on the delicate conditions needed for harvesting and drying - therefore, not all Moringa is made equal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To ensure nutrients are not damaged by the sunlight, our&nbsp;Moringa is harvested before dawn. The leaves are washed in purified water before drying. At this stage, the nutritional values of the leaf increases greatly - up to 10 X&nbsp;more than the fresh leaves!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The dried leaves are then ground into a ready-to-use green powder, perfect for giving your food and drinks a nutritional boost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does <\/strong><strong>Chirp Nation&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Moringa Powder taste like?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our&nbsp;Moringa Powder has a leafy, spinachy flavour which is often compared to the taste of Matcha. Unlike other green superfoods like Spirulina and Chlorella, Moringa isn&rsquo;t an algae so it doesn&rsquo;t have a strong, overpowering flavour and is easy to incorporate into your daily diet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the health benefits of using <\/strong><strong>Moringa<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A single serving of Chirp Nation Moringa Powder is packed with a variety of vitamins and minerals. It is a rich source of complete proteins with all 9 essential amino acids (incredibly rare for a plant), iron, vitamin E and K and a source and vitamin A and calcium. Moringa also contains 24% fibre. It has one of the highest antioxidant contents of any food. We like to think of it as nature&rsquo;s multivitamin! To find out some more details have a read through the benefits listed under the product description.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I use <\/strong><strong>Moringa<\/strong><strong> powder?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our Moringa has a green spinach-like taste and is easy to incorporate into your daily diet. Try blending it into smoothies (along with other superfoods if you like), mixing it with apple juice or using it as a &lsquo;superfood seasoning&rsquo; on your lunch or dinner. You can use it the same way as you would any veg, herb or seasoning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As Chirp Nation Moringa Powder is 100% pure leaf powder, there&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t mix it with - just let your imagination run free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the nutritional differences between <\/strong><strong>Moringa<\/strong><strong> powder and fresh <\/strong><strong>Moringa<\/strong><strong> leaves?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When Moringa leaves are shade-dried like Chirp Nation Moringa, the nutritional content increases by over 10 X&nbsp;so generally speaking dried Moringa leaf powder has a far superior nutritional value than fresh leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The only nutrient that is reduced by the drying process is the vitamin C content which is higher in fresh leaves. Additionally, Moringa in its powdered form is much easier to incorporate into your diet especially if you are living in a climate where it doesn&rsquo;t grow and it has a much longer shelf life than fresh Moringa leaves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why have I read conflicting information about the amount of vitamin C in <\/strong><strong>Moringa<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is often reported that Moringa powder is rich in vitamin C however, this is inaccurate. While it is true that fresh Moringa leaves are high in vitamin C (containing 200mg per 100g), when Moringa leaves are dried to form a powder, the vitamin C levels diminish considerably. Dried Moringa powder has on average around 2mg of vitamin C per 100g, which is not enough to be classified as a source (it would need 12mg per 100g).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it safe to consume during pregnancy?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking If you are pregnant or trying to conceive, we recommend seeking medical advice before taking Moringa or any of our other products.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That being said, you may be interested to know that if you are breastfeeding, Moringa has been scientifically proven to increase breast milk! This is because the leaves are a natural galactagogue, a substance that promotes or increases the flow of a mother&rsquo;s milk. #Food4Thought&nbsp;<\/p>","enable_payment_button":true,"show_share_buttons":true}},"product-recommendations":{"type":"product-recommendations","blocks":{"1576217304104":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"coma_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/up-coma-icon.jpg","testimonial_text":"A Delicious Daily Boost and love that the packaging is Recyclable!","star_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/stars-icon.jpg","client_name":"Anna"}},"1576217313695":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"coma_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/up-coma-icon.jpg","testimonial_text":"Love the Range of products!","star_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/stars-icon.jpg","client_name":"Samantha"}},"1576217316714":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"coma_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/up-coma-icon.jpg","testimonial_text":"Awesome concept and great tasting products","star_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/stars-icon.jpg","client_name":"Tom"}}},"block_order":["1576217304104","1576217313695","1576217316714"],"settings":{"testimonial_title":"What our Customers Say","product_benefit":"Product Benefits"}},"superfoods":{"type":"superfoods","blocks":{"1576755828303":{"type":"superfood","settings":{"superfood_feature_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gluten_free_icon_edited.png","superfood_feature_text":"Gluten free"}},"1576755833397":{"type":"superfood","settings":{"superfood_feature_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/non_gmo_edited.png","superfood_feature_text":"GMO Free"}},"1576755836633":{"type":"superfood","settings":{"superfood_feature_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/soy_edited.png","superfood_feature_text":"Soy Free"}}},"block_order":["1576755828303","1576755833397","1576755836633"],"settings":{"superfood_banner_text":"","superfood_banner_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Untitled_design_61_edited_2.png","superfood_content_title":"Why Superfoods","superfood_content_video":"","superfood_why_us_title":"WHY US","superfood_why_us_content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever wondered how a nutritional label gets created, or how much if any credibility underpins a company’s product claim?
